Partial differential equations (PDEs) describe the relationships among
the derivatives of an unknown function with respect to different
independent variables, such as time and position. For example, the heat
equation can be used to describe the change in heat distribution along a
metal rod over time. PDEs arise as part of the mathematical modeling of
problems connected to different branches of science, such as physics,
biology, and chemistry. In these fields, experiment and observation
provide information about the connections between rates of change of an
important quantity, such as heat, with respect to different variables.
These connections must be exploited to find an explicit way of
calculating the unknown quantity, given the values of the independent
variables – that is, to derive certain laws of nature. While we do not
know why partial differential equations provide what has been termed the
“unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences” (the
title of a 1960 paper by physicist Eugene Wigner[[1]](#_ftn1)), they
provide the foundation for a robust and important field concerned with
applied mathematics. A very large fraction of solvable PDEs are either
linear first- or second-order PDEs, or are related to such PDEs by
transformation or perturbation theory. Fortunately, these PDEs also make
up the language for much of the mathematical description of nature. Most
of this class will concentrate on those equations whose tremendous
importance to real-world applications has been established. Because
methods for finding exact or approximate solutions to partial
differential equations tend to be rather specialized, it is important to
be able to classify these equations. Accordingly, notation, specialized
terminology, and the classification scheme for partial differential
equations will constitute the subject of Units 1 and 2. Subsequent units
will examine some major solution methods: Fourier series and the Fourier
transform, separation of variables, the method of characteristics, and
impulse-response methods. This course is a way of dipping your toes into
the vast pool that is analysis and solution of PDEs, a place where some
people spend their whole lives.

### Course Information

Welcome to MA222: Introduction to Partial Differential Equations. Below,
please find general information on this course and its requirements.
This a very challenging course! In addition, while it does have strong
theoretical underpinnings, it is much more a survey of methods than a
construction of theory from first principles. Think of it as the
assembly of a toolkit for the solution of PDEs, rather than a definitive
overview of the theory of PDEs, a field far too broad for any course to
encompass. For that reason, the same problems are solved multiple times
and from a variety of perspectives. This means that if something does
not click for you after a great deal of persistence, move on. You can
return to any of these concepts/methods at a later point, and you may do
better once you have gained a different perspective on the problem (This
advice applies most strongly to Units 3-5, but the exception to it is
the technique of separation of variables. If you only have one hammer in
your toolkit, that is the one you need, so persevere!)­­

  
    
 **Course Designer: Clare Wickman**  
    
 **Primary Resources: **This course is comprised of a range of different
free, online materials. However, the course makes primary use of the
following materials:  
  

-   Cambridge University Press: Professor Marcus Pivato’s *[Linear
    Partial Differential Equations and Fourier
    Theory](http://www.saylor.org/content/general/Cambridge_PDE.pdf)*
-   University of Minnesota: Professor Peter Olver’s *[Introduction to
    Partial Differential
    Equations](http://www.math.umn.edu/~olver/pdn.html)*

   
 **Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials.
Pay special attention to Unit 1 as this lays the groundwork for
understanding the more advanced, exploratory material presented in
latter units. You will also need to complete:  
  

-   Subunit 2.1.2 Assessment
-   Subunit 2.2.1 Assessment
-   Subunit 2.2.5 Assessment
-   Subunit 3.1.1 Assessment
-   Subunit 3.2.4 Assessment
-   Subunit 4.1.3 Assessment
-   Subunit 4.1.4 Assessment
-   Subunit 4.2.1 Assessment
-   Subunit 4.2.2 Assessment
-   Subunit 4.2.3 Assessment
-   Subunit 4.3.1 Assessment
-   Subunit 4.3.3 Assessment
-   Subunit 5.1.4 Assessment
-   Subunit 5.2.3 Assessment
-   The Final Exam

   
 Note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final Exam.
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through the assessments listed above.  
    
 In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher
on the Final Exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as
you complete it. If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
    
 **Time Commitment:** This course should take you a total of **109.75
hours** to complete. Each unit includes a “time advisory” that lists the
amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit. These should
help you plan your time accordingly. It may be useful to take a look at
these time advisories and to determine how much time you have over the
next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set goals for
yourself. For example, Unit 1 should take you 5 hours. Perhaps you can
sit down with your calendar and decide to complete subunit 1.1 (a total
of hours) on Monday night; subunit (a total of hours ) on Tuesday night;
etc.  
    
 **Tips/Suggestions:** There is too much in the primary resources for
this course to use in just one semester, so explore the books a bit on
your own to see if you wish to learn more about any particular
subject.  
    
 As you read, take careful notes on a separate sheet of paper. Mark down
any important equations, formulas, and definitions that stand out to
you. These notes will be useful as a review when you study for your
Final Exam.  
    
 For extra help with this material, see Professor Paul Dawkins’ *Paul’s
Online Math Notes*. He has some good material on PDEs and boundary value
problems.
