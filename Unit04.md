**Unit 4: Solution Methods** <span id="4"></span> 
*Dozens of methods have been developed to solve the most common PDEs
over the past 300 years, and many tools have been developed to analyze
PDEs that cannot be explicitly solved. Many approaches are seemingly* ad
hoc*, although in many cases deeper reasons emerge for their efficacy.
In this unit, we deal with three main classes of solution methods, some
of which are more broadly applicable than others.*  
  
 *First, we deal with the use of characteristics to solve traveling-wave
problems (both linear and nonlinear). The method of characteristics is
used for evolution equations in which, in some way, the initial
information is conserved. This subject can be quite complicated, but is
a good preparation for the d’Alembert solution to the wave equation in
one space dimension. Finally, the exploration of solutions to wave
equations ends with an introduction to similarity methods. The transport
equation is used as an example.*  
  
 *Next, the technique of separation of variables is explained. This is,
possibly, the most important technique that you will learn in this
course, and it relies on the insight that, in many cases, the effects of
changes in the independent variables on the solution to a PDE are
independent *– *they can be isolated. Your readings begin with a
recapitulation of the exponential* ansatz *for solutions to the Heat
equation, which is used to motivate separation in the cases of the wave
equation and, most powerfully, the Laplace and Poisson equations. Many
examples with different boundary conditions are explored, and the
technique is linked back to the Fourier series described in unit 3.*  
  
 *The last component to this unit is the use of impulse-response
methods. This may be the most challenging material in this course; it
relies on the calculus of generalized functions, which is explained in
detail before it is used. Full justification of the use of such methods
is reserved for a graduate course in functional analysis, but these
methods are too powerful to neglect, even without such rigorous defense.
In fact, choosing to peruse these topics would provide sufficient
exposure at this point of the study of PDEs. Bear in mind that a Dirac
delta “function” is used to model a sharp blow to a system, as you did
in the ODEs course. Such sharp blows occur for systems whose
mathematical description requires PDEs as well. In turn, Dirac
delta-type functions naturally arise in the PDEs themselves.*  
  
 *The last of the main solution methods suitable for an undergraduate
introduction to PDEs is the Fourier transform, for which the last unit
of this course has been reserved.*

    the long-time behavior of the heat equation (the way solutions decay
    as time approaches infinity), which are important when discussing
    Fourier series solutions. Three boundary value problems are then
    discussed: the heated ring, inhomogeneous boundary conditions, and

     By now you have almost certainly noticed that solving many PDEs, at
    least using separation of variables, reduces to finding roots of
    polynomials. There is a deep link between abstract algebra and PDEs,
    and it is touched upon in this section, which should give you a new
    perspective on the structure of PDEs.

     The delta “function” is not a function *per se*; strictly speaking,
    it is a distribution. Nevertheless, it is one of the most useful
    abstractions in analysis, PDEs, and mathematical physics. This
    reading develops the idea of the delta function and how it can be
    combined with standard techniques from calculus and Fourier
    analysis.

     Recall Green’s formula, which is practically a restatement of the
    integration-by-parts formula; it relates integrals of the
    derivatives of a function on a domain to integrals of the normal
    derivative of the function around the boundary. Solving boundary
    value problems involves making this relationship balance out, and
    one way to conceptualize this balancing act is through the use of
    Green’s functions. The two most important concepts in the
    construction of a Green’s function are the **delta function**
    introduced in the previous section, and the **superposition
    principle** (also called **Duhamel’s principle** in this setting).

     In this reading, the author quickly reviews calculus in
    **R<sup>2</sup>** and then constructs the two-dimensional delta
    function before constructing the Green’s function for the Poisson
    equation. To do so, he proves **Green’s representation formula**, to
    which you should pay close attention. Be sure to work through the
