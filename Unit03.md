**Unit 3: Fourier Series on Bounded Domains** <span id="3"></span> 
*As you may have learned in a physics (or music!) class, every sound is
made up of sound waves with different frequencies. Thus, for instance, a
C-major chord based at middle C is made of up waves at 261.6 Hz(C),
329.6 Hz (E), and 392.0 Hz (G). The combination (or superposition) of
these three individual sound waves produces a new and distinct sound. In
fact, any signal or waveform (subject to some reasonable conditions) can
be written as the combination of some fundamental waves, whether it is a
water wave, a light or electromagnetic wave, or a sound wave.
Mathematically, a waveform is just a function, and, conversely, every
function can be viewed as a waveform. Most (again, subject to some
reasonable conditions) can be written as a combination of some
fundamental wave-like functions, namely sines and cosines. This was the
observation of Fourier, a great scientist of the nineteenth century. It
took years for other mathematicians to accept his work and come up with
a theoretical framework for his results. The study of such ideas is
today called Harmonic Analysis, and it has gone far beyond Fourier’s
original ideas to touch almost every part of modern science and
technology, from medical imaging to wireless communication.*  
  
 *In this unit, you will learn to apply Fourier’s original
insight *– *that most useful functions can be written as linear
combinations of sine and cosine waves. To do this rigorously, some
mathematical underpinnings must be established, such as the definition
and elaboration of the square-integrable functions, the differences
between different modes of convergence, and the orthogonality of the
basis of trigonometric functions, some of which you will recall from
MA241. After this has been accomplished, you will learn how to calculate
Fourier series for suitable functions.*

     In many cases, solutions to PDEs can be constructed using sequences
    or series of functions. However, as you know from calculus, the
    construction of a sequence or series does not guarantee that it has
    a well-defined limit. For this reason, the author defines several
    modes of convergence, which will be used to establish the validity
    of these types of solutions. The diagrams used to illustrate these
    concepts are excellent.
