**Unit 2: Classification of Linear PDEs** <span id="2"></span> 
*There is an incredible amount of variety in the study of PDE problems,
in part because of the incredible amount of variety in the physical
systems that many of them model. Over the course of the last 300 years,
many different mathematicians and physicists have tackled the same
problems and come up with diverse approaches to solving them, each
adding new richness to the field. While this diversity makes for very
interesting problems, it can devolve into a theoretical Gordion knot
when considered without a strong and well-defined framework to anchor
the novice student. For that reason, we will wait to touch on the most
common solution methods until Units 3-5. In this unit, we will attempt
to impose some order on our approach so that as you learn different
solution methods, you will understand the broad classes of functions to
which they apply, as well as the complications that make one method
appropriate for one situation, but not for another.*  
  
 *The unit begins with a refresher on the concept of linear operators,
essential for the classification of linear PDEs. Equations are
classified as homogeneous or nonhomogeneous, and evolution or
nonevolution. The readings for the unit detail the different types of
boundary conditions and their physical significance. The different types
of linear PDEs are explained. Finally, the concepts of uniqueness and
well-posedness are elaborated, and uniqueness under suitable conditions
is established for some of the most important PDEs.*  
  
 *If your mathematical background does not include a course in real
analysis, you will likely find this unit more comprehensible if you
first skip ahead to Units 3 and 4 and study some of the more tangible
solution techniques. In so doing, do not worry about the technical
assumptions required to ensure that the techniques “work.” Rather,
assume what you need and focus on the techniques and what they produce.
Once you are comfortable with this, then go back to Unit 2 and work
through the mathematical underpinnings. As you do so, keep in mind what
you learned in Units 3 and 4 as a target to which the theory will
inevitably be applied. *

**Unit 2 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 11 hours to complete.
